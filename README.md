# MyReads Project
This is the final project for the React Fundamentals Course, which is a part of Udacity's React Nanodegree Program.

MyReads allows the user to manipulate three "bookshelves"; a "currently reading" shelf, a "want to read" shelf, and a "read" shelf. The user can search for new books to add, change the shelf a book is on, or remove a book from being a part of any shelf.

### Quickstart
Install the project dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
Get the project running with `npm start` or `yarn start`.

### Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

### Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
